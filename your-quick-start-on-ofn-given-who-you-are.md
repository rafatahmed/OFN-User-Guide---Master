# Where does my business fit in OFN?

Depending on the type of food enterprise you are running, you will use the Open Food Network platform differently.

We classify food enterprises in three ways: [Profiles](your-quick-start-on-ofn-given-who-you-are.md#profile), [Shops](your-quick-start-on-ofn-given-who-you-are.md#shop) or [Hubs](your-quick-start-on-ofn-given-who-you-are.md#hub).

_The flexibility of the Open Food Network software allows you to change from profile,_ _to shop, to hub \(or vice versa\) as your business grows and/or needs change._

## Hub

{% hint style="success" %}
Farmers' Market, Veg box scheme, Crofting Groups, Social Food Community groups, Food Coops, Food hubs, CSA, Market/City gardens, Retail shops, Food Banks, Wholesale Distributors...
{% endhint %}

Hubs can take many forms but, in essence, your enterprise is best classified as a 'Hub' on OFN if you wish to **sell produce made by others.** You can retail your own products alongside those of other farmers, bakers, growers... \(a '**Producer Hub**'\) or act solely as a distributor to sell a collection of groceries made by \(local\) enterprises \(a '**Non-Producer Hub**'\).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you'd prefer to sell only products that **you** make then the '[shop](your-quick-start-on-ofn-given-who-you-are.md#shop)' classification suites your needs better.
{% endhint %}

### OFN can help your hub thrive and prosper by:

1. Increasing your online visibility.
2. Providing your customers with a virtual 'farmers' market' experience
3. Streamlining your admin tasks with stock levels, orders, finances, packing reports all in one place.
4. Being able to take orders periodically to fit in with seasonal supply, production rotas and more...
5. Helping organise regular repeating orders such as veg box schemes.
6. Helping to build strong working relationships with local producers and food enterprises who supply you with goods.

_The Hub enterprise has the most flexibility of the three enterprise types in OFN and you may find it necessary to adjust your enterprise type to 'hub' in order to unlock some of the more complex features we can offer._

**Setting up on OFN** can be as simple following 5 steps, just follow our quick starter's guide [here](quick-start-guides/multi-producers-shop-hub-quick-setup-guide.md).

## Shop

{% hint style="success" %}
Farmers, Bakers, Growers, Individual Crofters, Cottage Enterprises, Small Holders....
{% endhint %}

Shops can take many forms but in essence, your enterprise is best classified as a 'Shop' on OFN if you wish to **sell** _**only**_ **produce** that **you** make.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you'd wish to sell products made by others as well as yourself then it is necessary to register as a '[Hub](your-quick-start-on-ofn-given-who-you-are.md#hub)'.
{% endhint %}

As a shop; as well as selling directly to customers through your shop front; you can also supply other OFN retailers \(Hubs\) with your produce.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you'd prefer not to organise sales to customers directly but would like to **only** supply an OFN hub with goods then the '[Profile](your-quick-start-on-ofn-given-who-you-are.md#profile)' classification suits your needs better.
{% endhint %}

### OFN can help your shop thrive and prosper by:

1. Increasing your online visibility.
2. Streamlining your admin tasks with stock levels, orders, finances, packing reports all in one place.
3. Being able to sell in a manner which suits your needs, whether it is periodic orders to fit in with a seasonal potato harvest or a weekly cycle which matches your baking production... it's up to you!
4. Helping to build strong working relationships with local food distributors.

**Setting up on OFN** can be a simple 5-step process, just follow our quick starters guide [here](quick-start-guides/producer-shop-quick-setup-guide.md).

## Profile

{% hint style="success" %}
Farmers, Bakers, Growers, Individual Crofters, Cottage Enterprises, Small Holders....
{% endhint %}

The 'Profile' is the most basic enterprise classification on OFN and is ideal for micro enterprises or individuals who prefer to concentrate on growing, making, baking and/or producing food.

An OFN profile is ideal for **increasing your online visibility** and gives you the opportunity to connect in a simple manner with local retailers \(hubs\) who can manage customer sales for you.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you'd prefer to organise sales to customers yourself then the '[shop](your-quick-start-on-ofn-given-who-you-are.md#shop)' or '[Hub](your-quick-start-on-ofn-given-who-you-are.md#hub)' classification is better suited to your needs.
{% endhint %}

### OFN can help your food enterprise thrive and prosper by:

1. Increasing your online visibility.
2. Helping to build strong working relationships with local food distributors and retailers \(OFN hubs\) to whom you supply goods.

**Setting up on OFN** can be a simple 4-step process; just follow our quick starters' guide [here](quick-start-guides/profile-only-quick-setup-guide.md).
